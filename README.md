# UCSD_HW19_Progressive-Web-Applications-PWA-
In this unit, we would learn about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), which blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. PWAs use the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses, which ensures that the application will continue to work without an internet connection.
